Senior Project

This is an old project that I did with a couple other guys for our senior design project. At Oregon State University, electrical engineering students are required to go through a year-long program where we go through an entire design cycle. Some of the things that we were required to do seemed pretty ridiculous to me, but then I was also an older student, so possibly some of the lessons about responsibility etc. were lost on me.

At any rate, I wanted to post the files and such so that I would have a good place to keep them, as well as something to point to from my blog.
